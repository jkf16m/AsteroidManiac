# Hello and welcome!

This is my first deployed game, usually I make some simple games on pygame or stuff made on p5 online.
But I decided to make my first serious attempt at making a small, updatable game, with github repository and all.

I know, I should've made that with previous simple practice games, but I just didn't have that thought.
Until I realize how much good potential projects I've wasted on not doing so.


Now, this is my first potential game.


## What is this game about?

You control a space ship, it will destroy asteroids, that's it.
The thing is, these asteroids have different randomized parameters, that determine how much destructible they are.
Each second in the game, makes the game harder and unpredictable, but of course I aim to make it forgiving.

Asteroids shouldn't reach a maximum amount of speed (fractured asteroids).
The spaceship has a simple weapon, that can be adjusts its firerate and power.
The firerate and power are inversely proportional, the more firerate you have, the less powerful the bullets are.

## Versions

- v0.1 - In summary, this version will aim to make the spaceship itself
- v0.2 - This version should add one simple type of asteroid
- v0.3 - The asteroid now should fragmentate into other asteroids
- v0.4 - The game should have a background counter
- v0.5 - Now the asteroids should have a difficulty progression, the asteroid factory will adjust the level of
the asteroid made.
